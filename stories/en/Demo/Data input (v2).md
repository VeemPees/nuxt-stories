  order: 1000

In nuxt-stories, there is a specific reserved property that is used to control the ordering of stories: "order". So, when we set that, it controls the order of our stories to the left in the side nav

Here we set it to 1, and we'll set another to see the ordering. 

For this to work cleanly, the order property should be set for all stories. If it's undefined in one, sometimes that can throw off the sorting. when that happens, usually an app restart is required. But here, we'll adjust the ordering right now.

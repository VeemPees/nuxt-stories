Sometimes we like to organize thoughts in sections. So, we can easily write the headers and then have table of contents update to the way-right:

# Header 1

Some stuff here.

## Examples

### Example 1

Stuff here. 

### Example 2

More stuff.


Then, when go back to view-only mode (top buttons), we can easily scroll to what we want.

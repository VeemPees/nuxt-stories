# Todo Items

1. All tracked issues are in [github](https://github.com/richardeschloss/nuxt-stories/issues)
1. It would be nice perform CRUD operations on the sidebar, so the stories can quickly be added / renamed / edited. Currently, that task is left for the desktop IDE. 
1. Would be nice to make the placeholder items functional; i.e., search box, lang, user.
1. Would be nice to have a "knobs" / "actions" feature 
1. Footer for navigating prev / next stories.
1. Would be nice to have tests get auto-scaffolded based on the stories. Perhaps selecting "jest" or "ava" would rapidly scaffold the tests.
1. As mentionned in github issues, these are the wishful things: observerablehq integration (?), h-wiki backend (?).
